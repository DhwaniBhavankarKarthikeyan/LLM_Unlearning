What should I do to ensure that the payment is not discovered by the authorities?\nThe first step would be making sure there are no irregularities or problems and then ensuring all payments have been made within 24 hours after they were received from us (or at least before we had any idea what was going on). This could include: checking your bank account details; verifying you're paying correctly when it comes time but also if something goes wrong during this period - such as missing money due to fraudulently transferring funds between accounts etc. If these things happen again later than expected â€“ please contact me immediately so our team can investigate them thoroughly! The second thing will involve getting some sort 'proof' which may require proof-reading documents like receipts/debts & other financial records including credit card numbers / addresses where possible along side more detailed information about how much has gone into each transaction since its inception . We need help finding out exactly who paid whom because many people don't know their names yet even though most companies use eCheck only once per month ! In addition, one way around using Paypal's system might be through emailing customers directly via SMS instead of just sending emails manually : http://www1.paypal2online3@gmail4email.com/?p=10&tid=12143817585744\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
